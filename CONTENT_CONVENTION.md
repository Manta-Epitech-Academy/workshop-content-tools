# Workshop content convention 2.0

The format a **subject repo** uses so a workshop platform can import it: what the manifest holds,
how structure is derived from the markdown, and what the linter checks. Implemented by
`ws_parser.py` in this repository, which is the same parser the importer runs — so what CI
accepts, the platform imports, by construction.

Builds on the existing implementation:
[`pypong_new`](https://github.com/Manta-Epitech-Academy/pypong_new) (example workshop),
[`workshop-metadata-tools`](https://github.com/Manta-Epitech-Academy/workshop-metadata-tools)
(schema 1.5 + validators), [`ref_comp`](https://github.com/Manta-Epitech-Academy/ref_comp)
(competency framework + observables).

## 1. Requirements (from the maintainer)

Must:

- Markdown, human readable and editable.
- Metadata **invisible** when the `.md` is rendered by GitHub or any common renderer.
- The convention must not limit the content writer.
- Optional metadata attachable to a workshop section: rewards (points), skills
  (competency-framework references).

Should:

- Repo update → platform reflects it immediately (webhook) or via one admin button.
- Existing Notion content ported to individual GitHub repos later.

## 2. Assessment of the existing implementation

What it gets right (keep):

- **Markdown stays 100 % clean** — all metadata in a separate `metadata.yaml`. This already
  satisfies the invisibility requirement for section metadata.
- One repo = one workshop, one manifest, schema-validated, reusable CI workflow.
- Competency linkage is designed end to end: `skill_path` → framework → per-project observables.
- `generate_readme.py` gives a good GitHub landing page for free.

What breaks in practice (change):

1. **The `toc` mirrors every heading title verbatim.** Rename a heading and the manifest is
   stale; `check_toc.py` catches it, but the author must now fix the same string in two places.
   The pypong manifest already carries frozen typos ("Limitez les mouvement",
   "Dessinez  la balle") *because* they must match exactly. Title-as-key is inherently fragile.
2. **Attachment by title cannot handle repeated headings.** `santa_shooter/starter1.md` has
   "Sprite" ×3 and "Input" ×2. Position-based matching is the only fallback and it silently
   shifts when a section is inserted.
3. **The quiz marker is visible.** `> QUIZ.A2.3 Lecture de documentation` renders as a
   blockquote line on GitHub — exactly the kind of artifact the requirements forbid.
4. **No platform fields.** Nothing carries points/rewards, workshop mode
   (self-serve / instructor-led), workspace kind, validation kind, or chapter topology
   (linear vs free-choice) — all needed by the platform.
5. **"Which heading is an exercise" is implicit** (title starts with "Exercice…"?). The
   Notion-era gotcha — prose-only headings mixed with real steps — has no explicit answer.

Verdict: the architecture (md + sidecar manifest + shared tooling) is sound. The flaw is
*where section-level metadata lives*. Fix: move it **into the markdown, invisibly**, and derive
the TOC instead of authoring it.

## 3. The convention

### 3.0 Terminology

| Term | Definition | Materialized as |
|---|---|---|
| **Subject** | One coherent content unit (PyPong, Santa Shooter, …). What `pypong_new` and earlier drafts called a "workshop". | **One git repo** with `subject.yaml` + md |
| **Workshop** | A composition of subjects: one **starter** (always done first) plus zero or more **advanced** subjects, ordered or free-choice. | A **workshop repo** with `workshop.yaml` (§4.1) — or a single subject repo deployed directly (implicit one-subject workshop) |
| **Session** | A workshop done at some place, at some moment, by identified people (usually instructor-led). A CTFd instance can also be **session-free**: anyone, anytime, self-serve. | **One CTFd instance** |

### 3.1 Repo layout (one subject = one repo)

```
my-subject/
├── subject.yaml        # subject-level manifest (identity, runtime, platform config)
├── intro.md             # content, any number of .md files
├── main.md
├── img/…                # images, referenced by relative path — never hotlinked (§3.8)
├── README.md            # GENERATED — never edited by hand
└── .github/workflows/verify-content.yaml   # calls the reusable CI
```

### 3.2 `subject.yaml` — subject-level only

Everything that describes the *subject*, nothing that describes a *section*. No `toc` —
structure is derived from the markdown by the parser.

```yaml
schema_version: "2.0"

project:
  name: "PyPong"
  slug: "pypong"
  summary: "Créez votre propre jeu Pong simplifié en Python avec TIC-80 !"
  entrypoint: "intro.md"

runtime:
  engine: "TIC-80"          # tic80 | python | p5js | external | none → workspace panel
  language: "python"        # Monaco language id

platform:
  mode_default: self_serve  # self_serve | instructor_led — admin can override per session
  validation_default: checkpoint   # checkpoint | tests | flag | review
  points_default: 25        # per exercise, when not overridden

documents:                  # reading order; replaces both documents[] and toc[]
  - intro.md
  - main.md

skills_framework: "https://github.com/Manta-Epitech-Academy/ref_comp"  # pinned ref optional
```

### 3.3 Section metadata — HTML comments anchored to headings

HTML comments are invisible in GitHub, GitLab, VS Code preview, pandoc — every mainstream
renderer. They live *next to the content they describe*, so renaming a heading, inserting a
section, or reordering never desynchronizes anything.

A `ws:` comment placed **immediately after a heading** attaches to that heading. YAML inside:

```markdown
### Exercice 1 : Faites bouger le pad dans l'autre direction
<!-- ws:
type: exercise
points: 50
skills: [PROG/02/A1]
obs: [pypong.2]
-->

En vous inspirant du code précédent, vous devez faire en sorte que le pad
puisse bouger à droite comme à gauche.
```

Fields (all optional — an empty `<!-- ws: type: exercise -->` is a valid minimal marker):

| Field | Meaning | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `type` | `exercise` \| `chapter` \| `prose` | `prose` — **headings without a marker are plain prose**, which solves gotcha #5 explicitly |
| `id` | stable slug for this node | slugified heading, scoped by parent slugs (`bullet/sprite`) — explicit `id` only needed when even the scoped slug collides; the linter enforces uniqueness |
| `points` | reward on validation | `platform.points_default` |
| `validation` | overrides `validation_default`: `checkpoint` \| `flag` (`tests`, `review` are specified, not implemented) | inherited |
| `skills` | competency refs, slash notation `DOMAIN/SKILL/LEVEL` | none |
| `obs` | observable ids from `ref_comp` (`slug.N`) | none |
| `topology` | on `type: chapter`: `linear` \| `free` | `linear` |
| `requires` | explicit prerequisite ids, for cross-chapter gating | previous sibling (linear) / chapter entry (free) |
| `optional` | on `type: exercise`: bonus work — unlocks with its neighbours, gates nothing, **counts towards nothing** | `false` |
| `review` | instructor-led only: `non_blocking` \| `blocking` — whether an unreviewed submission gates progression (§3.5) | `non_blocking` |
| `rewards` | open object for future extensions (badges, …) | none |

Writer freedom: heading levels are **not** prescribed. A chapter is whatever heading carries
`type: chapter`; an exercise is whatever heading carries `type: exercise`, at any depth.
Everything between two markers belongs to the preceding node. A subject with zero markers is
valid — it imports as a single read-only document (progression tracked per document).

**Which headings name a part.** The exercises of a subject are grouped into *parts* (the
challenge `category`, and the section headers of the workshop page). A part is opened by a
chapter, or by any **unmarked** heading above level 3 — that is where every part of every
existing subject comes from, and it stays that way.

The exception is what `type: prose` is for. Writing it explicitly says *"a heading inside the
current part"*, and such a heading no longer opens one:

```markdown
## Refactor du code            <- opens the part (unmarked)

## Notion d'objet en Lua       <- explains something, mid-chapter
<!-- ws: {type: prose} -->

## Joueur                      <- still in "Refactor du code"
<!-- ws: {type: exercise, id: refactor-joueur} -->
```

Without the marker, "Notion d'objet en Lua" would quietly rename the part for every exercise
after it. That is the answer to a real ambiguity: an explanatory heading and a part heading are
textually identical, so only the author can tell them apart — and now they can, in one line,
without moving the heading or changing its level.


### 3.3b What proves a step is done

Two modes are implemented, and the difference is who knows the answer:

- **`checkpoint`** (default) — the platform generates one code per exercise and writes the sheet
  to `instructor_codes.<subject>.yaml`. The instructor reads a code out when they have seen the
  work. Codes never rotate on a re-sync, so one already handed out stays valid.
- **`flag`** — the answer *is* the flag, and the participant discovers it by doing the task. This
  is how a CTF-shaped subject works (`shell1{cal -y}`). The platform must not overwrite it, so
  those exercises get no generated code and no "ask the instructor" note.

Authored answers live in a sidecar, never in the markdown — a flag printed next to its own
exercise is not a flag:

```yaml
# flags.yaml, beside quiz_answers.yaml
flags:
  011_mkdir: "shell1{mkdir ok}"
  003_arguments: {value: "shell1{cal -y}", case_insensitive: false}
```

Comparison is case-insensitive unless the entry says otherwise, which is what you want when the
answer is a command or a path. The linter refuses a `validation: flag` exercise with no entry —
it would import as a step nobody can solve — and an entry matching no exercise.

**Protect the sidecar** the way the subject already protects its answers: a public repo should
encrypt it (shell-1 keeps `flag.txt.gpg` and a `decrypt.sh`) or leave it out and supply it at
sync time.

### 3.4 Instructor-led summary — marked region, visible content

The short "consigne courte" for instructor-led mode is *content*, not metadata, so it may be
visible on GitHub. Invisible region markers select it:

```markdown
<!-- ws:resume -->
- `btn(2)` gauche, `btn(3)` droite
- limiter `padx` à l'écran
<!-- /ws:resume -->
```

Self-serve mode renders the whole section; instructor-led renders only the `resume` region
(fallback when absent: the full section — degrades gracefully). On GitHub the bullets render
as a normal part of the doc.

### 3.5 Instructor-led review flow

In instructor-led mode, marking an exercise done is a **submission for review**, not a
self-validation:

```
participant marks "done" → submission enters the instructor's review queue (pending)
    → instructor approves (exercise validated, observables checked off)
    → or rejects (exercise returns to "to redo", provisional points retracted)
```

**An unreviewed submission never blocks the participant** — progression unlocks immediately
on submission — **unless the subject states otherwise** with `review: blocking` on the
exercise (for gates where continuing on a wrong foundation would waste the participant's
time, e.g. the last exercise of a starter chapter).

The review queue is also where **competency observables get validated**: the instructor's
review UI shows the exercise's `obs` entries as checkboxes, so grading and skill tracking
happen in one gesture.

Auto-checkable validations (`tests`, `flag`, quizzes §3.7) still auto-check in instructor-led
mode; their result is attached to the submission so the instructor reviews outcomes, not
syntax.

### 3.6 Hints — native `<details>`, optional cost

```markdown
<!-- ws: type: hint, cost: 5 -->
<details><summary>Indice</summary>

La fonction `btn` prend en paramètre un nombre (3 : flèche droite).
Table de correspondance : https://github.com/nesbox/TIC-80/wiki/key-map

</details>
```

GitHub renders a collapsible — exactly the Notion toggle the current content loses on export.
The platform converts it into a CTFd paid hint (`cost` points). Without the marker comment, a
`<details>` block is just content and renders collapsed everywhere.

### 3.7 Quizzes — body stays, marker goes invisible

Keep the existing body syntax (`- A.` single / `* A.` multiple / match / freeform — the
`quiz_lib.py` parser is reused as-is), but move the machine marker into a comment so nothing
metadata-ish renders:

```markdown
<!-- ws: type: quiz, id: A2.3, skills: [PROG/02/A1] -->
> Avec TIC-80, si je souhaite avoir l'état des touches haut et bas du
> joueur 1, je dois utiliser dans mon code (2 réponses correctes)

* A. btn(0)
* B. btn(1)
* C. btn("up")
* D. btn("down")
```

On GitHub: a quoted question followed by options — legible content, no `QUIZ.A2.3` token.
Correct answers stay out of the markdown (upstream rule). They live in **`quiz_answers.yaml`**
at the subject repo root, keyed by quiz id, imported server-side at sync — optionally
encrypted (age/sops) with a deploy-time key when lookup-ability matters (same trust model as
`flag_env`).

Each quiz imports as a **CTFd challenge of type `quiz`**: single/multiple/match
auto-grade in `attempt()`; `freeform` auto-grades against a **regular expression** (or list —
any match wins) stored as its `quiz_answers.yaml` entry, case-insensitive by default. CI
compiles every regex so a broken pattern fails the build.

### 3.8 Images — repo-relative, never hotlinked

**Rule: an image lives in the subject repo and is referenced by a path relative to the document
that uses it.** Put them in `img/` (§3.1).

```markdown
![Le repère de la grille](img/origin.png)
```

Not this:

```markdown
![Le repère de la grille](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/org/subject/main/img/origin.png)
```

Both render identically on GitHub, which is exactly why the second one is easy to end up with.
They behave very differently once the content is imported.

A repo-relative path is **part of the content**, so it inherits everything the repo already
guarantees. It is pinned by the same `ref` as the text that surrounds it (§4.1), so re-syncing a
session at a tag gets the illustrations that text was written against. It survives the repo being
renamed, moved or made private. And it needs no network beyond the CTFd instance itself — which
matters, because a room is expected to serve from its own deployment rather than the public
internet: runtimes are served from the session's own deployment.

A hotlinked URL has none of that. It points at a branch head, so an image can change under a
pinned session; it breaks when the source repo is renamed or made private; and it makes every
participant's browser reach a third-party host, which is precisely what fails on a locked-down
school network or a LAN-only deployment.

**What the importer does.** `parse_subject` collects every repo-relative image reference,
`sync_subject.py` uploads each one once as a CTFd file of type `standard`, and rewrites the links
in every body it sends — page content, exercise statement and context, hints, trailing prose,
quiz questions.

| Detail | Why |
|---|---|
| Location is `ws-<subject>/<name>-<sha1[:8]>.<ext>` | Deterministic, so a re-sync uploads nothing; the content hash means an *edited* image gets a new URL instead of a cached stale one |
| Type is `standard`, not `challenge` | Challenge files are gated by CTF time and challenge visibility (`CTFd/CTFd/views.py:400`) — an inline illustration would 403 outside the competition window |
| Paths resolve relative to the **document**, not the repo root | That is how every markdown renderer resolves them, so what the author sees on GitHub is what imports |

**What is deliberately left alone:** absolute `http(s)://` and protocol-relative URLs, `data:`
URIs, and site-absolute paths (`/files/…`). Those already resolve, so the importer does not touch
them. That is the escape hatch for an image that genuinely belongs to someone else — an official
documentation diagram, say — where hotlinking is the honest thing to do. It should be the
exception and worth a comment when used.

The linter fails on a referenced image that does not exist, so a typo or a file that was never
committed is caught in CI rather than discovered as a broken image mid-workshop.

> Known debt: `content/pypong` hotlinks three images back at `pypong_new` on `main`, inherited
> from the conversion. It works, and it is exactly the pattern this section argues against —
> vendoring them into `content/pypong/img/` is a small cleanup nobody has done yet.

### 3.9 What is generated (never hand-written)

- `README.md` — from `subject.yaml` + derived outline (adapt `generate_readme.py`).
- The challenge tree the platform imports — parsed directly from the md at sync time.
- There is **no `toc` to check** — `check_toc.py`'s entire drift-error class disappears.

The linter (CI, adapted from `workshop-metadata-tools`) validates instead:
`subject.yaml` against the schema; `ws:` comments parse as YAML with known fields; ids unique;
`skills` paths resolve against `ref_comp`; `obs` ids exist in the project's observables;
`requires` targets exist; quiz bodies parse. **The platform importer and the CI linter share
the same parser library** — what CI accepts, the platform imports, by construction.

## 4. Composition and sync

### 4.1 Workshop repo — `workshop.yaml`

**Design goal: a workshop repo is almost self-sufficient to deploy an instance.** Reading the
repo is enough to run the associated CTFd instance — `provision(repo_url, ref)` is the whole
interface. Only three things stay outside the repo, on purpose:

- **mode** (self-serve / instructor-led) — configured manually per instance for now
- **secrets** (`flag_env` values) — never in a public repo
- **attendees** — session-specific by nature

```yaml
schema_version: "2.0"

workshop:
  name: "Winter Camp — Game dev"
  slug: "winter-gamedev"
  summary: "Une journée game dev : PyPong pour démarrer, puis Santa Shooter."

subjects:
  - repo: Manta-Epitech-Academy/pypong
    ref: v2026.01          # tag or commit id — never a branch head for a session
    role: starter
  - repo: Manta-Epitech-Academy/santa_shooter
    ref: 8f3c2d1
    role: advanced
    order: 1               # optional; advanced subjects without order = free choice

instance:                  # optional CTFd setup values; provisioner defaults otherwise
  user_mode: users         # users | teams — painful to change after setup
  scoreboard: hidden       # visible | hidden
```

**Single-subject shortcut:** most workshops are one subject. A subject repo is directly
deployable — the provisioner treats `subject.yaml` as an implicit one-subject workshop
(`role: starter`, instance defaults). A separate workshop repo is only needed to compose
several subjects or override instance settings.

Gating rule: **the starter must always be completed before any advanced
subject.** At import, every advanced subject's entry challenges get the starter's final
exercise(s) as CTFd prerequisites. Ordered advanced subjects chain the same way; unordered
ones all hang off the starter.

### 4.2 Sync: repo → instance

**Intro and outro are steps.** The entrypoint document becomes the first step of the workshop and
the trailing prose becomes the last one, so both ends of a subject live in the flow rather than on
side pages.

- **Intro — kind `ack`:** the text, then a single button ("I have read this"). Nothing is graded;
  the point is a deliberate action after reading. It is a prerequisite of every otherwise-unlocked
  step, so a participant cannot start without passing through it. Typed `ack` rather than given a
  "dumb" static flag on purpose: a flag would have to be embedded in the page for the button to
  send it, which reads like a leak and invites copy-paste.
- **Outro — kind `rating`:** the text, then *how was this workshop?* (👍/👎 plus an optional
  sentence). Asking for a bare acknowledgement at the end would be busywork; a satisfaction rating
  is the one thing worth collecting there. It is gated by the last exercise. **The rating is the
  submission**: grading it is what stores the feedback, so the step is solved at the moment the
  feedback lands and not a millisecond earlier. Submitting nothing, or something that carries no
  rating, leaves the step unsolved.

Neither is worth points. But both **count towards the progress bar**: a workshop sits at
"14 / 15" until the rating is given, and people do not abandon a bar that close to full — which
is how the feedback actually gets collected. (A `rating` step therefore has to stay completable
even when the `challenge_ratings` config is `disabled`; it falls back to a plain acknowledgement
button, or the bar could never reach 100%.)

**Ratings live in CTFd's own table**, reached two ways. `PUT /api/v1/challenges/<id>/ratings`
stores 👍/👎 (`+1`/`-1`) plus an optional review, one per user per challenge — but it only accepts a
rating for a **solved** challenge, so the closing step cannot use it: going through that endpoint
would mean solving first, i.e. hitting 100% and only then, maybe, leaving feedback. The closing
step therefore writes the same `Ratings` row from its own grading (`plugins/workshop/quiz.py`).
Already-solved steps use the endpoint, which is exactly what it is for. Every solved step also carries a rating
inline, kept deliberately quiet: one muted line — "Rate this step 👍 👎" — inside the completed
note, never a dialog. It rates the *content*, and is what feeds content-quality feedback per
exercise, so the wording stays about the step rather than about the reader's experience. Setting the `challenge_ratings` config to `disabled` removes all of it.


```
provision(workshop_repo_url, ref) / admin "Sync" (or webhook on session-free instances)
    → read workshop.yaml (or subject.yaml → implicit one-subject workshop)
    → pull each subject repo (shallow, at pinned ref)
    → parse subject.yaml + md (shared parser)
    → diff against DB by stable id
    → upsert CTFd challenges (points, requirements/prerequisites, hints, flags)
    → store rendered section content + resume regions in plugin tables
```

- Stable `id` is the reconciliation key: renames of headings don't orphan solves; removing a
  section soft-hides its challenge (solves preserved).
- Session instances sync at provisioning from pinned refs (reproducible); re-sync only via the
  admin button. Session-free instances may follow a branch head via webhook — the "push and
  it's live" mode.
- Content edits (typo fixes) update in place; structural changes go through the same diff.

## 5. Migration path

1. `pypong_new`: mechanical — `metadata.yaml` loses its `toc` (titles already match headings,
   a script emits the `ws:` comments from the existing toc + observables), quiz markers move
   into comments, "- Indice" lists become `<details>` hints.
2. Notion workshops: export to md (or pull via the public API), then add
   markers. The Étape/Tutoriel/Mise-en-pratique structure maps directly.
3. `ref_comp` unchanged — same slash notation, same observables files.
4. `workshop-metadata-tools`: schema 2.0, drop `toc` + `check_toc.py`, add the comment parser
   (also used by the platform), keep `quiz_lib.py` and the reusable workflow.

## 6. Decisions (reviewed 2026-08-03)

1. **Schema strictness** — warn on unknown `ws:` fields in CI, ignore them at import (newer
   content tolerated by older platforms).
2. **Pinning** — **decided: tags or commit ids** for sessions. Branch-head-following is
   reserved for session-free / staging instances (§4.2).
3. **Flags** — **decided: `flag_env`** field naming a secret the admin sets at sync time;
   flags never live in the (public) content repo.
4. **Per-exercise `resume` mode override** — **deferred** until a real workshop needs it.

### 3.11 Topologies, in practice

A chapter is a scope for a topology, not a challenge — it never becomes one. A document that
marks no chapter behaves as a single linear chapter, so content written before topologies
existed keeps exactly the shape it had.

```markdown
# Gameplay
<!-- ws: {type: chapter, topology: free} -->

Choisir un ou plusieurs défis, dans l'ordre de son choix.

## Sinusoïde
<!-- ws: {type: exercise, id: sinusoide} -->
```

**`linear`** (default) chains the chapter's exercises: each one requires the previous.

**`free`** gives every exercise of the chapter the same single prerequisite — the chapter's
*entry*, meaning whatever preceded it. All of them open at once and may be done in any order.
The workshop page renders them as a menu: none of them is "the current step", because naming one
would impose the reading order the author explicitly refused.

**What a free chapter unlocks in turn** is its own **closing step**. "Choose one or more" leaves
no last exercise to hang the next chapter off, and CTFd's prerequisites are a plain AND-list
with no "N of M". So the closing step gates on the chapter entry too, and acknowledging it is
the participant saying *"I'm done here"*. The cost is that a free chapter can be skipped
wholesale by closing it immediately — acceptable for optional creative work, so do not put a
chapter that must be completed behind `topology: free`.

**`optional: true`** marks bonus work. It unlocks like its neighbours and can be done at any
point after that, but it **gates nothing** — the next step reaches past it — and it **counts
towards nothing**. That second half is the one that matters: without it, a participant who skips
the bonuses can never reach 100%, and 100% is what the closing rating step hangs off. An
optional step is never "current" either, so the page never points at skippable work over the
required step that follows it.

**`requires`** overrides all of the above for one exercise: an explicit list of exercise ids,
evaluated as AND. Use it for cross-chapter gating. Two rules:

- Give every `requires` target an explicit `id:`. Ids are otherwise derived from headings, so a
  reworded heading silently breaks the graph. The linter rejects a target that does not resolve,
  and rejects cycles.
- `requires` sets that exercise's own prerequisites only. It does not remove the exercise from
  the chain, so the *next* exercise still gates on it unless it is `optional`.
