"""Shared parser for subject repos (docs/CONTENT_CONVENTION.md).

Reads `subject.yaml` + its markdown documents and produces the structure the
platform imports and the CI linter validates — one parser for both, so what
CI accepts, the platform imports, by construction.

Model produced (see Subject):
  documents (in subject.yaml order)
    nodes: heading-anchored, typed by the `ws:` comment that follows the
           heading — `chapter` / `exercise`; unmarked headings are `prose`
    inline within a node body: hints (marker + <details> block),
           quizzes (marker + blockquote question + option list),
           a resume region (instructor-led summary)

Conventions implemented here:
- A `<!-- ws: ... -->` comment holds YAML (flow or block) and attaches to the
  nearest preceding heading; `type: hint` / `type: quiz` markers instead
  attach to the content block that follows them.
- Headings inside fenced code blocks are ignored.
- Prose content is not lost: each exercise carries `context_md`, the bodies of
  the prose/chapter nodes between the previous exercise and itself — so an
  imported exercise is self-sufficient reading (the Phase 0 lesson).
- Exercise `category`: title of the nearest enclosing chapter or *unmarked*
  heading. An explicit `type: prose` marker keeps a heading out of that
  structure, so a mid-chapter explanation does not rename the part.
- Quiz options: `- A. text` (single) / `* A. text` (multiple) /
  `- A. …` + `- a. …` rows (match), per workshop-metadata-tools QUIZ.md.
